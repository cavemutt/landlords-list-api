This is the final project for the Promineo Tech Backend Developer Course.

# Landlords List API

This project uses Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Spring JPA, Lombok, MySql Workbench, DBeaver, Eclipse IDE and ARC to show how it works and the exception codes thrown.

A contributor can add to, update, retrieve and delete landlord info including the units and regions of the landlord. You may also get the list of landlords and all info by regions and by one region in particular (regions are pre-populated in the table).
